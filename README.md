## Display Tables
```SQL
SELECT * FROM public.RepairTechnicians
SELECT * FROM public.RepairJobs
```
## Task 1: Aggregate Functions and Subqueries
Task: Find the average number of years of experience for technicians who have performed repair jobs on bicycles costing
more than $100. Include the technician's name and the average experience.
```SQL
SELECT rt.FirstName, rt.LastName, ROUND(AVG(rt.Experience),2) AS average_experience 
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
WHERE rj.cost > 100
GROUP BY rt.FirstName, rt.LastName;
```
## Task 2: Combining Joins and Subqueries
Task: List the names of technicians who have not performed any repair jobs.
```SQL
SELECT rt.FirstName, rt.LastName
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
WHERE rj.TechnicianID IS NULL;
```
## Task 3: Using EXISTS and IN ( I used HAVING)
Task: Find the technicians who have worked on repairs for bicycles owned by more than one person. Include the technician's name 
and the count of distinct bicycle owners.
```SQL
SELECT rt.FirstName, rt.LastName, COUNT(DISTINCT rj.BicycleOwner) AS OwnerCount
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
GROUP BY rt.FirstName, rt.LastName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT rj.BicycleOwner) >= 2;
```
## Task 4: Subqueries with GROUP BY and HAVING
Task: Identify technicians who have performed repairs on at least 2 bicycles and list the total number of repairs they have conducted.
Include the technician's name and the total number of repairs.
```SQL
SELECT rt.TechnicianID, rt.FirstName, rt.LastName, COUNT(DISTINCT rj.JobID) AS OwnerCount
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
GROUP BY rt.TechnicianID, rt.FirstName, rt.LastName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT rj.JobID) >= 2;
```
## Task 5: Subqueries with AND, OR, and NOT
Task: List the technicians who have performed repairs on bicycles with a cost between $50 and $150 OR have more than 7 years of experience. 
Include the technician's name and the repair cost.
```SQL
SELECT rt.FirstName, rt.LastName, rj.Cost
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
WHERE (rj.Cost BETWEEN 50 AND 150) OR (rt.Experience > 7);
```
## Task 6: Combining EXISTS and Aggregate Functions
Task: Find technicians who have not performed any repairs on bicycles with a cost exceeding $200. 
Include the technician's name and the total number of such repairs.
```SQL
SELECT rt.FirstName, rt.LastName, COUNT(rj.JobID) AS TotalExpensiveRepairs
FROM RepairTechnicians rt
LEFT JOIN RepairJobs rj ON rt.TechnicianID = rj.TechnicianID
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM RepairJobs rj2
    WHERE rj2.TechnicianID = rt.TechnicianID
    AND rj2.Cost > 200
)
GROUP BY rt.FirstName, rt.LastName;
